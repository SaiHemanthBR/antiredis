# antiredis

#### This is a learning project and is not intended to be used in a production environment.

antiredis is an In-Memory Database that's exactly the opposite of Redis. Its neither fast nor reliable nor secure nor persistent. Its just an in-memory database, that I wrote to learn how SQL databases work and to learn how to implement a SQL parser. It is a very simple database, supporting only a few basic single table operations.

I might implement a full SQL in-memory database (something like redis) in the future, but no guarantees.
